**Year:** 2024

## Abstract

AI-powered characters that simulate believable human behavior using large language models. The agents have an architecture that stores memories, reflects on experiences, and plans future actions. Demonstrated in a Sims-like sandbox with 25 agents, they autonomously perform daily activities, form relationships, and coordinate complex social behaviors (like organizing a Valentine's Day party from a single prompt).
